Developed a novel speculative decoding method leveraging advanced statistical sampling techniques, achieving faster inference and improved token acceptance rates while maintaining long-range consistency in LLM outputs.

This code applies the algorithm to the Alpaca dataset.

It includes both the original speculative sampling algorithm and the novel approach. Multiple experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the results. For a detailed explanation of the algorithm and experimental findings, please refer to the accompanying report.
